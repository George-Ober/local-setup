Agriculture is a crucial sector not only for human's food security but also for livestock and other crop products such as textile, paper, or fuel. However, this sector is facing significant challenges such as climate change, droughts, diseases or soil degradation due to chemicals. A vulnerable agricultural field has devastating consequences for the ecosystem and living beings. In the 1840s in Ireland, potato blight infected potato crops, causing famine and the death of more than a million people. This incident is known as the Potato famine. A more recent incident happened in the United States, where a corn leaf blight infected corn crops, causing losses in billions of dollars. Therefore, agricultural threats and instabilities have considerable costs on the population and the economy. It is estimated that more than 20% of crops a year are lost due to diseases, that is $220 billion USD according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations[^1].

In recent years, agriculture has undergone a transformation towards "smart farming," leveraging advanced technology to improve crop health and productivity. The implementation of intelligent crop management systems can significantly influence both food quality and economic outcomes. 

To facilitate this, we’ve seen various methods being employed, in various sub-branches of agriculture.  Precision agriculture, often referred to as precision farming, involves the use of technology and data-driven approaches to optimize various aspects of farming, including the use of fertilizers, which we are going to focus on.

  

One ongoing trend in fertilizer innovation is the development of smart or precision fertilizers, called Enhanced Efficiency Fertilizers. EEFs release nutrients gradually, over an extended period ensuring a steady supply to plants over time. By doing this, nutrients are used with better efficiency because they’re provided when plants need them most. Environmentally, EEFs decrease nutrient runoff into water bodies, preventing water pollution.

Because yes! Pesticides (insecticides, herbicides, etc.), like Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid are often sprayed over large areas. They can drift through wind or runoff into unintended locations, affecting non-target species and ecosystems[^2]. Pesticides can degrade soil quality, reduce fertility, and harm beneficial soil organisms. Efficiency Fertilizers do not directly contaminate water sources, when again, pesticides always find a way to pollute everything.

Over Reliance on pesticides can lead to resistance, ecological imbalances[^3], and ecosystem disruption[^4], because soils require balanced nutrient levels.

This method is also quite cost-effective: farmers need fewer applications of EEFs due to their slow-release properties, and this results in cost savings over time.

To summarize, EEFs contribute to sustainable agriculture by improving nutrient management, reducing environmental impact, and supporting long-term soil fertility. Farmers can achieve higher yields while minimizing resource wastage .

  

Now if you’ll indulge me, I will delve into more technical details about how EEFs can be put in place. 

  

It first starts by knowing what crops require more attention, now, you could go out in the field and look at every individual plant to see if something’s wrong with them, but, truth be told, we are in the 21st century, and of course, people are starting to use hyperspectral satellite imagery to infer the overall health of an area, using Machine Learning[^5].

For instance, Some neural networks prove especially effective in analyzing crop images from diverse sources such as satellites, aircraft, or ground cameras. These models utilize techniques like vegetation indexes and multispectral imagery for accurate assessment. Consequently, they help farmers help make informed decisions. 

  

The efficient fertilizers can then be dispatched either with tractors or drones, or when that’s not possible, even by hand, for more complicated procedures, like a practice named Rhizosphere Microbiome Engineering, which is an exciting area of research in agriculture that focuses on manipulating the microbial communities around plant roots. For example imagine all the microbes around the roots of a plant, scientists at the university of Kolkata have found that we can influence them[^6] to give more nutrient, health, but this is a little bit outside of the scope of this presentation.

In conclusion, Enhanced Efficiency Fertilizers (EEFs) are designed to increase the efficiency of nutrient use, reduce nutrient losses to the environment, and potentially increase crop yields. However, they also come with several potential drawbacks. Apparently EFs can have inconsistent Benefits[^7]. The effectiveness of these fertilizers is determined by complex interactions, and while we’ve seen that they do not pollute, but what they can cause, is a lot of political discussions, because new technologies are hard to implement in this industry, especially because what oftentimes blocks innovation is the pesticide manufacturers[^8]. Regulation and reform may help accelerate this change, because we’ve seen in the past few days that we really need to give credit where credit is due to the people who put food in our plate.
